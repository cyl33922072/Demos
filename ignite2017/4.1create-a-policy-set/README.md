# Create a Policy Set

Policy Set can group your policies logically by a purpose. This example creates a policy set to have all required billing tags by PowerShell. You can do this on Portal UI as well. 

## Explain how it works by using Powershell

1. The policy set references builtin tag policy mutliple tags

2. Open the azurepolicyset.definitions.json file and explain how policy set groups the 4 policies and how parameters work.

3. Run demo.ps1 to create policy set and assignment

4. Go to the portal, create a storage account from portal and verify the tags are automatically created.
