# Create a Policy Set

Policy Set can group your policies logically by a purpose. This example creates a policy set to have all required billing tags by PowerShell. You can do this on Portal UI as well. 

## Explain how it works by using Powershell

o	The policy set references builtin tag policy mutliple tags
o	Open the azurepolicyset.definitions.json file and explain how policy set groups the 4 policies and how parameters work.
o	Run demo.ps1 to create policy set and assignment
o	Go to the portal, create a storage account from portal and verify the tags are automatically created.
